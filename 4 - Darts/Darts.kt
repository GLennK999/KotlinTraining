/*
Calculate the points scored in a single toss of a Darts game.

Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target.

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.
The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, where x and y are real), calculate the correct score earned by a dart landing at that point.
